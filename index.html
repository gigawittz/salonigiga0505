        <h1>Hey! Shona.....</h1>
        <hr/>
        
        <p>
            I find myself searching for the perfect words to express the depth of my love for you, but no words seem quite sufficient. Every moment we’ve shared, every laugh, every challenge, has woven our lives together in a way that feels destined and beautiful.
            <br><br>
            From the first time we met, I felt a spark—a sense that you were someone truly special. Over time, that initial spark has grown into an all-encompassing flame. You’ve become my confidante, my muse, my greatest joy. Your love has taught me what it means to truly be cherished, and I am endlessly grateful for the happiness you bring into my life.
            <br><br>
            I can’t help but imagine a future where every day begins and ends with you. A future where we continue to grow together, building a life filled with love, laughter, and shared dreams. You’ve made my life richer and more meaningful in ways I never thought possible, and I want nothing more than to spend every waking moment with you.
            <br><br>
            So today, I want to ask you something that I’ve been dreaming of for a long time. Will you do me the incredible honor of becoming my partner for life? Will you marry me and make me the happiest person in the world?
            <br><br>
            I promise to love you unconditionally, to support you through all of life’s ups and downs, and to cherish every moment we share. My heart is yours, today and always.
            <br><br>
            <strong>With all my love,</strong>
        </p>
        
        <h4>Yours, _GIGA__</h4>
